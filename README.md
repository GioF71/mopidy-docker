# mopidy-docker

Run Mopidy in Docker

## Description

I wanted to be able to play from Tidal to my audio devices (typically Raspberry Pi SBCs), directly from a browser, without using Tidal Connect, not available on any device/platform.  
[Mopidy](https://mopidy.com/) along with the [Mopidy-Tidal plugin](https://github.com/tehkillerbee/mopidy-tidal) offer a very nice interface, and represent a good response to this requirement.  
Also, I like Mopidy to be able to connect to [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) for music playback, as I am starting to explore this option.  
I have only used it with alsa output, but I will probably add support for PulseAudio soon. Note that this is not terribly important to me, at least when using Tidal, which my main scenario.  Using this application with PulseAudio would not offer any particular advantage compared to the Tidal Web Player.  

## Support

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/H2H7UIN5D)  
Please see the [Goal](https://ko-fi.com/giof71/goal?g=0).  
Please note that support goal is limited to cover running costs for subscriptions to music services.

## Build

If, for any reason, you don't want or cannot use the images I publish to the [Docker Hub Repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/giof71/mopidy), you can build the image locally by switching to the root directory of the repository and issuing the following command:

`./local-build.sh`

The configuration if driven by environment variables. You should not need to edit the configuration files directly.

### Volumes

VOLUME|DESCRIPTION
:---|:---
/config|Configuration directory
/data|Data directory
/cache|Cache directory
/music|Music directory

## Examples

A simple docker-compose.yaml file.  
Please note that this assumes your user of choice has uid `1000` and that the audio gid is `29`.  
The audio gid is generally `29` for debian base distros, including Moode Audio.  
Also the selected audio output is the alsa device named `D10` (matches the card name of a Topping D10).  
The Tidal plugin is enabled with LOSSLESS quality.  
Make sure you create the `config`, `cache` and `data` directories where you place this `docker-compose.yaml` file, and that those directories are writable for the user identified by the uid (`1000` in the example) and gid (`29` in the example) that you choose.  

```text
---
version: "3.3"

services:
  mopidy:
    image: giof71/mopidy
    container_name: mopidy
    user: "1000:29"
    devices:
      - /dev/snd:/dev/snd
    environment:
      - AUDIO_OUTPUT=alsasink device=hw:D10
      - RESTORE_STATE=yes
      - SCROBBLER_ENABLED=${SCROBBLER_ENABLED:-}
      - SCROBBLER_USERNAME=${SCROBBLER_USERNAME:-}
      - SCROBBLER_PASSWORD=${SCROBBLER_PASSWORD:-}
      - TIDAL_ENABLED=yes
      - TIDAL_QUALITY=${TIDAL_QUALITY:-LOSSLESS}
    ports:
      - 6680:6680
      - 8989:8989
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - ./cache:/cache
      - ./data:/data
    restart: always
```

In order to correctly set the credentials for Tidal, the first run should be done with this command:

`docker-compose run mopidy`

Look at the displayed instructions. The log should present a line similar to the following:

```text
mopidy-app | INFO     2024-11-17 11:37:31,306 [39:TidalBackend-7 (_actor_loop)] mopidy_tidal.backend
mopidy-app |   Please visit 'http://localhost:8989' or 'https://link.tidal.com/XXXXX' to authenticate
```

follow the second link, authenticate with Tidal (if necessary) and authorize the new device on Tidal.  
If, for any reason, you want to use the `PKCE` authentication, use the first link and follow the instructions that will be presented.  

You will need an active Tidal subscription, of course.  
After this action, you can stop the container (CTRL-C), and then start it normally using:

`docker-compose up -d`

The application should be accessible at the host-ip at port 6680.
